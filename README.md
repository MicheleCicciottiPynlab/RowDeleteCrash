# RowDeleteCrash
Demo project for job interviews: demonstrates a real-world crash that the candidate should attempt to fix.

The app shows a list of items. By sliding them left, the items can be deleted. By touching the "action" button in the navigation bar, items are deleted from the end of the list until at most 20 items remain.

Deleting rows one by one works, but the "action" button makes the app crash: why?
